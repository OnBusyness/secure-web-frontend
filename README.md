### Consignes

1- Basic Layout
   The frontend is composed of at least:
1. One login page (containing a link to the register page)
2. One register page
3. One “Location” page in which all locations are listed in a paginated array

Je suis pas très fort donc en plus d'être en retard c'est pas beau 


2- User Stories

   US1: As a random visitor, I want to be able to register an account or log-in, so I can
   access all features

OK

   US2: As a random visitor, I want to be redirected to the login/register page when I click on
   “location" tab, so that I know I must log-in to see its content

OK 

   US3: As a logged-in user, I want to see locations and be able to click on one location to
   open a modal containing details, so that the website is useful

OK

   US4: As an “admin" user, I want to see a “Add Location” button in the location page, so
   that I can create a new location

NOP

   US5: As an “admin" user, I want to see a button to edit locations in the array of locations,
   so that I can edit existing locations

OK 

   US6: As an “admin" user, I want to see a button to delete locations in the array of
   locations so that I can delete existing locations
